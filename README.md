# Diabetes Prediction 🩺💉

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict diabetes based on various health indicators using the [Healthcare Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes).

## Workflow 🚀

### Data Collection:

- The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/healthcare-diabetes).
- Download and explore the dataset to understand the features and target variable.

### Pre-Processing:

- Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and transform features.
- Explore and visualize the data to gain insights into the distribution of variables.

### Modelling:

- Utilize machine learning models such as SVM and BaggingClassifier to predict diabetes.
- Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation:

- Assess the model's performance using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
- Interpret the results to understand how well the model generalizes to new data.

## Training and Evaluation 📊

- Load the dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
- Train the model using the BaggingClassifier with 150 estimators.
- Evaluate the model on the test set and analyze the confusion matrix and accuracy.
- Achieved accuracy on the test set: 99.28%.
- Achieved accuracy on the training set: 100%.
